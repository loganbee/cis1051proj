## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to do something with mental health. My current idea is to take a user input (they will be prompted to enter any negative thoughts or feelings) and create an algorithm that will recognize certain words or letters and show certain colors for each word/letter. This will most likely be hosted on a website, and I'm still not 100% sure what other elements I'll add to correspond with the colors / make it a more interactive and relaxing experience. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Just me :)

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If I come up with another idea I like better soon, do I need to submit a new preposal? Or do I just edit my readme file?
