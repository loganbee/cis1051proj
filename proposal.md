# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Color in Everything

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will be making a website that takes user input and outputs certain colors.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will most likely be hosted on a website. On this website, a user will enter negative thoughts and feelings into a form. An algorithm will either randomly generate colors for each word, or will recognize the first letter of a word and will upload the color that is stored in a dictionary with that letter. There are some drawing tools able to be easily implemented into a website, and if possible, the user may be able to draw with the generated colors. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Algorithm that matches colors to letters, a website with a form that users can input.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Generated colors being shown on the website as the user is using it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A drawing tool for the user to draw with the generated colors with.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to first complete the homepage supplementary activity. I have soe experience with HTML, but haven't used it in a while and would like a refresher. Within HTML, I will need to understand how to hide and show only certain images to the user.
